# Stock-Value-Screener

This project, made with Python and Jupyter notebook, uses the <a href='https://finnhub.io/'>Finnhub API</a> to screen stocks in the S&P 500 index and rank them by their estimated intrinsic value. Stocks are given a score of how undervalued they are relative to other stocks in the index. A DataFrame of the top undervalued stocks is  exported to a .xlsx file. The output includes a calculation of how many shares to buy of each stock, given a portfolio size. 

Inspired by the <a href='https://github.com/nickmccullum/algorithmic-trading-python'>Algorithmic Trading in Python</a> course.
